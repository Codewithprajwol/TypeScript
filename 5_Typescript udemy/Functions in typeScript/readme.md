Yes, you can use the function keyword with the Calculator type in TypeScript, but the syntax is slightly different. Here's how you can do it:

Using function Keyword with Type Annotations
If you want to define a function using the function keyword and ensure it matches the Calculator type, you can explicitly annotate the function like this:


type Calculator = (num1: number, num2: number) => number;

function add1(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    return num1 + num2;
}

Here:
add1 is a named function defined using the function keyword.
The parameter types (num1: number and num2: number) and the return type (: number) are explicitly defined, ensuring it matches the Calculator type.
Why Not Assign Calculator Type Directly to a function Keyword?
The function keyword is a standalone declaration in TypeScript. Unlike arrow functions, it can't directly have a type assigned to it using : Calculator. However, by providing the explicit parameter and return types, it still adheres to the Calculator type structure.


Comparison with Arrow Functions
When using arrow functions, the Calculator type can be directly assigned to the variable:


const add1: Calculator = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 + num2;
};
Both approaches achieve the same result. It's just a difference in syntax preference:

Use the function keyword for more traditional function declarations.
Use arrow functions for more concise, modern syntax.
