V8 Engine: Executes core JavaScript (ECMAScript).
Browser: Provides additional features like the DOM and Web APIs, implemented in its runtime environment.
Node.js: Provides platform-specific APIs for server-side JavaScript.
The separation ensures that JavaScript can run in multiple environments (browser, server, etc.) with the appropriate tools provided by each runtime.
