# optional properties - ?


## parameter properties is constructor ke ander nai initial and declear gardio vanya ...which we can do by using access modifiers


--- getter and setter

--- static and abstract

 due to static you can use properties variables inside class without new keyword ...thats it

 abstract vanya those class which we don't make any instances using new keyword rather we only include basics there and use inheritace so that that class remain abstract (hide)
