--premitives and refrences 
--- in typescript premitives are (number,string ,boolean) where other variable can copy it but 

--- in case of reference( i.e. non premitive) they cannot be coppied we are just refrencing (value aautai matra ho just we are refrencing)

# type annotations 
 --- let a:number;

# type inference
  --- let a=12 // here typescript is self thinking what might be the variable type ..... we are not defining.
